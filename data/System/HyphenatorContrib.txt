This is a jQuery plugin integrating [[http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/][Hyphenator.js]] by Mathias Nater.

Hyphenator.js ...

   * automatically hyphenates texts on websites
   * runs on any modern browser that supports !JavaScript and the soft hyphen (&shy;).
   * automatically breaks URLs on any browser that supports the zero width space.
   * runs on the client in order that the HTML source of the website may be served clean and svelte and that it can respond to text resizings by the user.
   * follows the ideas of unobtrusive !JavaScript.
   * has a documented API and is highly configurable to meet your needs.
   * supports a wide range of languages.
   * relies on Franklin M. Liangs hyphenation algorithm (PDF) commonly known from !LaTeX and !OpenOffice.
   * is free software licensed under LGPL v3 with additional permission to distribute non-source (e.g., minimized or compacted) forms of that code (see source code header for details).

   * English
   * German
   * French

A custom jQuery adapter makes sure text loaded asynchronously is processed later on as well.

For further information see http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/

---++ Usage

To load the hyphenator into the current page use 

<verbatim class="tml">
%JQREQUIRE{"hyphenator"}%
</verbatim>

Then add the =.hyphenate= class name to those html elements that contain text to be hyphenated.
Use =.donthyphenate= to exclude areas from being processed. The language used for processing the
text is extracted from the html language settings. 

<verbatim class="html">
<div class="hyphenate" style="text-align:justify">
This text is processed by Hyphenator.js

  <div class="donthyphenate">
    This text is _excluded_ from hyphenation
  </div>

</div>

This text is _not_ processed.

<div class="hyphenate">
This text is processed as well.
</div>
</verbatim>
