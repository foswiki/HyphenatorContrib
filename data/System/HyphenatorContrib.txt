This is a jQuery plugin integrating [[http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/][Hyphenator.js]] by Mathias Nater.

Hyphenator.js ...

   * automatically hyphenates texts on websites
   * runs on any modern browser that supports !JavaScript and the soft hyphen (&shy;).
   * automatically breaks URLs on any browser that supports the zero width space.
   * runs on the client in order that the HTML source of the website may be served clean and svelte and that it can respond to text resizings by the user.
   * follows the ideas of unobtrusive !JavaScript.
   * has a documented API and is highly configurable to meet your needs.
   * supports a wide range of languages.
   * relies on Franklin M. Liangs hyphenation algorithm (PDF) commonly known from !LaTeX and !OpenOffice.
   * is free software licensed under LGPL v3 with additional permission to distribute non-source (e.g., minimized or compacted) forms of that code (see source code header for details).

A custom jQuery adapter makes sure text loaded asynchronously is processed later on.

The default language is derived reading the language information of the html page as generated by your foswiki language settings.
Further more, specific parts of a page can be processed using different langugage patterns using an iso-639-1 language tag, e.g.

<verbatim class="html">
<div lang="en-gb">
This part is processed using the british hyphenation patterns.
</div>
</verbatim>

For further information see http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/

---++ Usage

To load the hyphenator into the current page use 

<verbatim class="tml">
%JQREQUIRE{"hyphenator"}%
</verbatim>

Then add the =.hyphenate= class name to those html elements that contain text to be hyphenated.
Use =.donthyphenate= to exclude areas from being processed. The language used for processing the
text is extracted from the html language settings. 

<verbatim class="html">
<div class="hyphenate" style="text-align:justify">
This text is processed by Hyphenator.js

  <div class="donthyphenate">
    This text is _excluded_ from hyphenation
  </div>

</div>

This text is _not_ processed.

<div class="hyphenate">
This text is processed as well.
</div>

<div class="hyphenate" lang="de">
Dieser Text wird mit deutscher Silbentrennung verarbeitet.
</div>
</verbatim>
